# Preface

This document is a case study for anyone with the following objectives:
- To create reports accompanying software development in Visual Studio Code
- To write a document in Markdown and submit it as PDF
- To make PDF build complete with command line operation only
- To style like Markdown display on GitHub
- To add a cover, table of contents, and  page numbers in PDF
- To automatically generate item titles, page numbers, and links within documents in the table of contents
- To put page numbers only on the text pages, excluding the cover and the table of contents
- To not include extra properties in PDF

I will introduce the work flow I used to obtain a PDF that meets all the above requirements.  (If some of the above requirements are not needed, there may also be different work flows.)

The content covered here is the work flow used to implement it in my environment without spending much time, and may not be the best practice. There is also a point of lack of versatility, but it would be fortunate if it would be a test bed for sharing better implementation methods.

I would like to express my gratitude to Mr. Keiichiro Shikano who reviewed this article before publication. Thank you very much.
